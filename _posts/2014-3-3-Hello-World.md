title: My summer research project with LUGE UBC

This summer I worked with Land Use Global Environment UBC creating a meta-analysis sheet comparing different agriculture methods around the world. We wanted to compare how productive and effective each agriculture methods are in respective to their control. This dataset will later go on a website and become an interactive site for people to view the results.
