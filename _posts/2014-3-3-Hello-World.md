Imagine you are heading down to your local food court for lunch. You decide on your meal based on the menu list and place your order with the cashier. The meal is then prepared for you behind the food court and when fully prepared, your lunch is ready to eat!

This is similar to what SQL or "Structured Query Language" does, not with your lunch, but with your database. You instruct SQL what to do with your data based on the functions list in the program and it will prepare the command on its end. When the data manipulation is completed, the data is ready for you to use!

SQL is an easy-to-use programming interface and known as a relational database management system or RDBMS. RDBMS is the basis for SQL which means that SQL interacts with relational databases or what is known as data tables. SQL can perform tasks on these data tables such as storing and querying data. We can also:

* <i>Define data</i>: normalize abbreviated values to full state names

* <i>Manipulate data</i>: example. replace blank or null value with a word

* <i>Retrieve data</i>: example. get numbers of sales for a particular group or time frame from database

(Vaidya, 2017) 

Additionally, SQL is able to handle optimizing and the maintenance of large, complex databases. Learning this specialized language can only take a short amount of time in order to become an active SQL user! So what makes SQL so user-friendly?

<b>It's simplicity:</b> 

SQL contains a limited number of functions used to run queries and return data. It offers the concept of accessing many records with one single command line and it eliminates the need to specify how to read a record (Wiki, 2019). SQL is also fast when working with large datasets and uses simple words and mathematics formulas that allows users to work easily with their data.

> Here is an example of what a SQL line would typically look like:

>Let's say you are working with a data table displaying how much ice-cream you sold this summer working in different cities around British Columbia. To find the sum of Burnaby's sales by the type of ice cream you would write: 

```<SQL>
SELECT * 
FROM Burnaby
ORDER BY Type of Ice-cream;
```

And it would create something like this:

```<SQL>
  +---------+-----------+--------------------+
  | MONEY   | City      | TYPE OF ICE CREAM  |
  +---------+-----------+--------------------+
  | 4.67    | Burnaby   | Chocolate          |
  | 8.34    | Burnaby   | Chocolate          |
  | 5.43    | Burnaby   | Match              |
  +---------+-----------+--------------------+
  ```
  
<i>Simple right?</i>


<b> What is in SQL? </b>

There are several language elements within the SQL language including:

* <i>Clauses</i>: includes the components of statements and queries. 

* <i>Expressions</i>: either produce scalar values or tables with columns and rows of data

* <i>Predicates</i>: specifies conditions that can be evaluated to SQL (for example: true/false/unknown) or Boolean truth values 

* <i>Queries</i>: retrieves data based on the specific criteria n

* <i>Statements</i>: controls the transactions, program flow, connection and sessions

(Wiki, 2019)

This specialized language is also not case sensitive and carries the basic commands such as "Select", "Insert", "Update", "Delete", "Create", and "Drop". This allows users to learn the language quickly and effectively, making it easy for them to accomplish everything needed to be done with the database. 

>The interface of SQL is also very friendly to use and familiar looking to anyone experienced with other computer languages. Here is what a typical Microsoft SQL Server screen looks like:

SQL can also be used from different application programs such as Oracle, another popular database management tool. In this case, the interface would look something like this:

<b> SQL is widely used: </b>

SQL is also widely used in businesses, other types of database administrations, and is the default tool to use on conventional databases. Non-coding professionals, such as workers in the marketing industry, have learned to use basic SQL to support their roles (SQLizer, 2017). The language is also used in the academic and in the working industry. 

In fact, in an analysis done by Tim Cashion, SQL is currently the most desired programming skill for data scientist roles around Vancouver!

So there definitely is a high demand for learning this language. 

I hope this gave you a quick overview of what SQL is, what it does, and why it may be useful for you to learn!
